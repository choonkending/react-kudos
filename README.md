Kudos React Component
=====================

A Kudos React Component inspired by [KudosPlease](https://github.com/TimPietrusky/KudosPlease).

It really is an awesome design, and I wanted to implement it as a reusable React component.

How to run:
-----------
1. `npm install`
2. `gulp`

How to view:
----------
Checkout out example.html

Todo:
-------
1. Implement kudos to persist in showing numbers.
2. Add additional icons that could be switched in easily.
